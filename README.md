# <!-- omit in toc --> Carleton Science Student Success Centre - Android App

This is the Android app for the Carleton University Science Student Success Centre. You can find the SSSC Server code [here](https://github.com/ScienceStudentSuccessCentre/SSSC-Server).

## Project summary

This project is the mirror version of the iOS Science Student Success Centre app, for Android! It allows students to view all of the events that are shown on the SSSC's website and quickly access the SSSC's resources page. 
Event data for both the Android and iOS apps are retrieved using a GET request to the SSSC Server (linked above) using the `/events` endpoint, to ensure their data is sychronized. 


## Next Steps

This app is currently incomplete. The Events and Resources pages are completed, but the grades page is still under construction.
